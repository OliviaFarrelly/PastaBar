					<h1>Brief</h1>
                <P> In this project we want to create three sprints to make computerised orders for a PastaBar. We want to include customer details, kinds of pasta ordered and pick up or delivery requirments into a computer and have it display the delivery details, itemised order and total cost.</P>

    <h1>Sprint One</h1>
                <hr>
               <h5><b>Brief</b></h5> 
                <p> In sprint one I got all my kinds of pasta organised. This meant their name, description of what the pasta is and the price of the pasta. I then wanted to create a function on pycharm that printed out a menu. This menu included all the information for the customer to choose from and have a clear idea of what each pasta contains. I then put it in a loop so I could ask the customer what they wanted to do. This loop had 2 options “P” for the print menu when the name description and price of each kind of pasta were printed. And “Q” is where you could quit the program and stop running. This was a basic sprint one as I just wanted to get the information onto the program so I could have a baseline sonic that could work from there. I also did a bit of formatting to make the program look nicer and easier to understand. This is all I did in Sprint one.  </p>

                <h5><b>Refelction</b> </h5>
          

		<uL>
            
        <li>I liked how clearly formatted it was. It was easy to understand and you can follow the program easily without getting lost or not understanding anything. I like how i managed to bold the names of the pasta as that is the main information and made it clear to customers what the pasta name was and what they would choose if they would like to order
</li>
            <br>
            <li>The description of the pats on the menu was another positive. Some people might not be able to understand from the pasta name what is in the pasta. The description clearly stated what the pasta was so people could easily choose what they wanted based on what was in the pasta dish.
</li>
            <br>
                <li>Next steps will be to add more pasta to the menu. I would like there to be more options to choose from as there aren't many. It should be pretty easy to add new kinds of pasta dishes to the menu as they are in lists so you just need to add new lists without having to alter anything. I will do this later on as it is easier to work with a small amount of pastas while creating the program rather than a wide range of options. 
</li>
                
                </uL>
                
    <p>Other than these things it was a pretty basic program with not much to do on it so there isn't much I need to improve or change as the program is not doing a lot yet just printing out the menu and then quitting the program. 
</p>

<h1>Sprint Two</h1>
                <hr>
 <h5><b>Brief</b></h5>   
                <p>In Sprint 2 I made a function where I could ask the customer what pasta they would like to add to their order. I printed out a little menu, this menu contains the name of the pasta and teh price as well as an index number for each pasta. I then asked what pasta they would like to add to their order. They provided me with a number that is next to the pasta. I then asked them how many of that type of pasta they would like to add to their order. I then put that into lists which I called customer order. I then made another function to review the order. This was very basic as it just printed out what was in their order so the name of the pasta and how many of that state would like to order.

 <h5><b>Refelction</b> </h5>
          

		<uL>
            
        <li>I liked how I could now add pasta to my order. It was clear to follow and you didn't get too confused. You were able to follow it all quite easily. I liked how i could easily choose the pasta i wanted to add with a number rather than having to type the pasta name and rising out being spent wrong and then throwing and error</li>
            <br>
        <li>I liked how when I went to add pasta to my order there wasn't any description of the pasta, just the passat name and the price. This made it clearer and easier. It made the screen less crowded and made ordering pasta easier. If they wanted to see the description they would look at the full menu which would include the description of the pasta. </li>
            <br>
        <li>I also liked how I could review the order, however this could be improved. I could add the price of each pasta added and the total price of everything so the customer can see everything going on. This is going to be done in my next sprint</li>
            <br>
        <li>Another problem that occurred was if someone added a pasta and then went and added two more of that pasta it makes a new list  in their order there will be two lists. This means that when they go to review their order there will be two parts: the name of the pasta and two different quantities. In further sprints I would like to be able to group them all together. </li>
                
        </uL>
                
        <p> Overall this sprint was okay. I was able to add new pastas and review my order. There were a few errors and in further sprints I would need to validate my program and deal with the repetition issues and everything. In the next sprint I want to be able to print a review order like a receipt so it has the price of each of the pastas and then a total price.   </p>

    
                
<h1>Sprint Three</h1>
                <hr>
                
                <h5><b>Brief</b></h5> 
                
                          <p>In this sprint, I did a few things. The first thing I did was I added more kinds of pasta to the menu. I did this by adding new lists to my pasta list with the name of the pasta, a small description and the price. This was all I had to do for this as everything else fixed itself around that. The next thing I did was work on my review function. Right now it only prints out the name of the pasta you order and how many of the pastries you order. I wanted to make teh review more like a receipt meaning it had the price of teh pasta but also the price of the total number you order. I also wanted a total price at the end with all the pasta prices added up. I wanted to clearly lay out everything so it looked like a clear receipt. That was all I wanted to do for sprint three. </p>

		<uL>
            
        <li>One thing I liked in this sprint was how there were more options of types of pasta you could add to your order. This made it more like a menu. There weren't too many options before this version and it was very basic. I was able to add these new pasta really easily. Because of the way I laid out the program I was just able to add a new list with the name of the pasta, the description and the prince and did this without having to alter the rest of the program which was very good. </li>
            <br>
        <li>Another thing I liked was how the review order function printed out like it was a receipt. I liked how you could look at the review function anytime and it would update with the new pasta you added. This was good as every time you changed something you good review your order again and get a new receipt</li>
            <br>
        <li>One thing that needs to be improved is still like the previous sprint which was if someone added pasta and then went and added two more of that pasta it makes a new list in their order there will be two lists. This means that when they go to review their order there will be two parts: the name of the pasta and two different quantities. In further sprints, I would like to be able to group them all together.</li>
            <br>
        <li>One thing I need to fix on the program is if you want to remove pasta from your order. I need to create a new function for this as it needs to be separate from the adding function and everything else. This will be a whole other sprint. </li>
                
        </uL>
                
        <p>Overall this sprint was good. It did what I wanted it to do as it printed out a nice receipt with everything you would have on it. For example, it had the number of each pasta you order, their price and then a total price at the end. I still need to validate my program and deal with the repetition issues and everything. Next sprint I want to be able to remove pasta from my order.</p>

                          <p>In this sprint, I did a few things. To start with I wanted to create a function where I could remove kinds of pasta from my order. I created a function where it would ask you what pasta you would like to remove and it removed all of that type of pasta from your order. The next thing I wanted to do was create a function where I could update pasta in my order. This was for people who didn't want to delete all of the pasta orders of that type of pasta; they were able to change how many they ordered. This was all my focus was on for sprint 4

        <li>One thing I like about this version is how if a person adds the wrong type of pasta they are able to remove it from the order with a click of a button. This then updates their order and their new total and is just really easy to navigate if you make mistakes
</li>
            <br>
        <li>Another thing I liked about this version is if the person adds too many or too little of a type of pasta and they just want to update their order, they are able to do that by clicking a button. They can then clearly choose what they want to update and they can change it to the amount they actually want. This also updates their order and then alters the total of how many they have ordered now. 
</li>
            <br>
        <li>Something that didn't go so well in this version was to go with the update order. When trying to work with this I had to alter and change it. It was quite confusing to work with and everything kept crashing. In the end, I got it working and it made my ordering system so much better and easier for customers who make mistakes. 
</li>
            <br>
        <li>Another thing that needs some work is validation, if the user doesn't type in the right thing the program will crash. I need to validate it so if the user does not put in the correct number or value the program will ask the question again because they would've just made a mistake. This will make everything easier for the user. 
</li>
                
        </uL>
                
        <p>Overall this version of the program has come out how I wanted it. It removes pasta from the order and the order can also be updated. There were a few bumps along the way but in the end, I got it to do what I needed to do. The next steps for the program would be to ask and retrieve the customer details. Asking if they would like pickup or delivery, getting their name, phone number and address for delivery. Also, I need to add three dollars to the order total if they would like it to be delivered. Another thing I need to do is validate my program at the end when everything else is completed.

                          <p>In this sprint, I wanted to focus on one thing and that was getting the customer details. I wanted to know if they wanted pickup or delivery. If they chose to pick up I asked for their name and phone number for their order. If they chose delivery I asked for their name and phone number again but this time I also asked for their address. Then in the review order function, I printed out the details as that function is like a receipt. I also then added three dollars to their total price as delivery requires a three dollar surcharge. This is all I did in sprint 5.

        <li>One thing I liked about this version was that the customer could decide if they wanted it to be picked up or delivered. This was the first question I asked when the customer went to the customer details section. This then led to asking more questions depending on what they chose. Getting their name and phone number for both options but getting their address if they wanted it delivered. 
</li>
            <br>
        <li>Another thing that worked well in this version was adding three dollars to the total price if they wanted it delivered this way. In the review of the order, if they chose delivery when they entered their customer details they could see that there were three dollars added and this helped them to understand why there was more money not just doing it without them knowing. 
</li>
            <br>
        <li>One thing that I liked was how the customer details were printed when they reviewed their order like a little receipt. This helped them see that everything we correct and that they will be getting the right order as it's under their name. It helps them feel more at ease as they know what is going on.
</li>
            <br>
        <li>Two things that need to be improved is validation. This is still a problem as if the user types in an incorrect value number or anything the program will crash instead of asking them again because they mistyped something. One Last thing that needs to be added is a confirmation section, this is where they can finish placing their order and cancel it or send it in and then they can either start a new order or quit. 
</li>
                
        </uL>
                
        <p>Overall this version did everything I wanted it to do, It got the customer's details and it printed them out in the review order function as well as adding three dollars onto the price if needed. Everything we clearly laid out and the customer could see what they were doing. The next steps are to add the confirmation function and get the order to be finished and ask the user if they want to start a new order. This is the last part of the ordering system that needs to be done and then the program needs to be validated to make everything easier for the user.

                          <p>In this sprint, I wanted to create a confirmation function. I wanted this function to first check if both the customer details and the customer order lists are full. If not, ask them to go make their order and then take them back to the menu. If those lists are full then ask them if they want to place their order. If yes, say thank you for ordering, then ask if they would like to make another order or quit the program. If they quit then stop the program if they want to make another order take them back to the menu. If they want to cancel their order then clear the lists and ask them if they want to make a new order and the same things as above apply. These are the finishing touches I needed on my program besides validation.
