					<h1>Brief</h1>
                <P> In this project we want to create three sprints to make computerised orders for a PastaBar. We want to include customer details, kinds of pasta ordered and pick up or delivery requirments into a computer and have it display the delivery details, itemised order and total cost.</P>

    <h1>Sprint One</h1>
                <hr>
               <h5><b>Brief</b></h5> 
                <p> In sprint one I got all my kinds of pasta organised. This meant their name, description of what the pasta is and the price of the pasta. I then wanted to create a function on pycharm that printed out a menu. This menu included all the information for the customer to choose from and have a clear idea of what each pasta contains. I then put it in a loop so I could ask the customer what they wanted to do. This loop had 2 options “P” for the print menu when the name description and price of each kind of pasta were printed. And “Q” is where you could quit the program and stop running. This was a basic sprint one as I just wanted to get the information onto the program so I could have a baseline sonic that could work from there. I also did a bit of formatting to make the program look nicer and easier to understand. This is all I did in Sprint one.  </p>

                <h5><b>Refelction</b> </h5>
          

		<uL>
            
        <li>I liked how clearly formatted it was. It was easy to understand and you can follow the program easily without getting lost or not understanding anything. I like how i managed to bold the names of the pasta as that is the main information and made it clear to customers what the pasta name was and what they would choose if they would like to order
</li>
            <br>
            <li>The description of the pats on the menu was another positive. Some people might not be able to understand from the pasta name what is in the pasta. The description clearly stated what the pasta was so people could easily choose what they wanted based on what was in the pasta dish.
</li>
            <br>
                <li>Next steps will be to add more pasta to the menu. I would like there to be more options to choose from as there aren't many. It should be pretty easy to add new kinds of pasta dishes to the menu as they are in lists so you just need to add new lists without having to alter anything. I will do this later on as it is easier to work with a small amount of pastas while creating the program rather than a wide range of options. 
</li>
                
                </uL>
                
    <p>Other than these things it was a pretty basic program with not much to do on it so there isn't much I need to improve or change as the program is not doing a lot yet just printing out the menu and then quitting the program. 
</p>

<h1>Sprint Two</h1>
                <hr>
 <h5><b>Brief</b></h5>   
                <p>In Sprint 2 I made a function where I could ask the customer what pasta they would like to add to their order. I printed out a little menu, this menu contains the name of the pasta and teh price as well as an index number for each pasta. I then asked what pasta they would like to add to their order. They provided me with a number that is next to the pasta. I then asked them how many of that type of pasta they would like to add to their order. I then put that into lists which I called customer order. I then made another function to review the order. This was very basic as it just printed out what was in their order so the name of the pasta and how many of that state would like to order.

 <h5><b>Refelction</b> </h5>
          

		<uL>
            
        <li>I liked how I could now add pasta to my order. It was clear to follow and you didn't get too confused. You were able to follow it all quite easily. I liked how i could easily choose the pasta i wanted to add with a number rather than having to type the pasta name and rising out being spent wrong and then throwing and error</li>
            <br>
        <li>I liked how when I went to add pasta to my order there wasn't any description of the pasta, just the passat name and the price. This made it clearer and easier. It made the screen less crowded and made ordering pasta easier. If they wanted to see the description they would look at the full menu which would include the description of the pasta. </li>
            <br>
        <li>I also liked how I could review the order, however this could be improved. I could add the price of each pasta added and the total price of everything so the customer can see everything going on. This is going to be done in my next sprint</li>
            <br>
        <li>Another problem that occurred was if someone added a pasta and then went and added two more of that pasta it makes a new list  in their order there will be two lists. This means that when they go to review their order there will be two parts: the name of the pasta and two different quantities. In further sprints I would like to be able to group them all together. </li>
                
        </uL>
                
        <p> Overall this sprint was okay. I was able to add new pastas and review my order. There were a few errors and in further sprints I would need to validate my program and deal with the repetition issues and everything. In the next sprint I want to be able to print a review order like a receipt so it has the price of each of the pastas and then a total price.   </p>

    
                
<h1>Sprint Three</h1>
                <hr>
                
                <h5><b>Brief</b></h5> 
                
                          <p>In this sprint, I did a few things. The first thing I did was I added more kinds of pasta to the menu. I did this by adding new lists to my pasta list with the name of the pasta, a small description and the price. This was all I had to do for this as everything else fixed itself around that. The next thing I did was work on my review function. Right now it only prints out the name of the pasta you order and how many of the pastries you order. I wanted to make teh review more like a receipt meaning it had the price of teh pasta but also the price of the total number you order. I also wanted a total price at the end with all the pasta prices added up. I wanted to clearly lay out everything so it looked like a clear receipt. That was all I wanted to do for sprint three. </p>

 <h5><b>Refelction</b> </h5>
          

		<uL>
            
        <li>One thing I liked in this sprint was how there were more options of types of pasta you could add to your order. This made it more like a menu. There weren't too many options before this version and it was very basic. I was able to add these new pasta really easily. Because of the way I laid out the program I was just able to add a new list with the name of the pasta, the description and the prince and did this without having to alter the rest of the program which was very good. </li>
            <br>
        <li>Another thing I liked was how the review order function printed out like it was a receipt. I liked how you could look at the review function anytime and it would update with the new pasta you added. This was good as every time you changed something you good review your order again and get a new receipt</li>
            <br>
        <li>One thing that needs to be improved is still like the previous sprint which was if someone added pasta and then went and added two more of that pasta it makes a new list in their order there will be two lists. This means that when they go to review their order there will be two parts: the name of the pasta and two different quantities. In further sprints, I would like to be able to group them all together.</li>
            <br>
        <li>One thing I need to fix on the program is if you want to remove pasta from your order. I need to create a new function for this as it needs to be separate from the adding function and everything else. This will be a whole other sprint. </li>
                
        </uL>
                
        <p>Overall this sprint was good. It did what I wanted it to do as it printed out a nice receipt with everything you would have on it. For example, it had the number of each pasta you order, their price and then a total price at the end. I still need to validate my program and deal with the repetition issues and everything. Next sprint I want to be able to remove pasta from my order.</p>
